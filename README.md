# bagels_project
python short game which is very good for beginners to start a small project which helps the understanding and maturity in python

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
the game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place,
Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.


I insisted on all who are new to programming how to do  this small project some steps will be followed-
First step ---> You can copy the code to become familiar with how they work
Second step --> Experiment with your own changes and see what happen if you change something and see the output 
Third step --> re-attempt to recreate in your own as a practice which gives an ideas of how to program and how to create
