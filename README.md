Programming has proven to be a powerful skill, creating billion-dollar tech companies and amazing technological advances. It’s easy to want to aim high with your own software creations, but biting off more than you can chew can leave you with half-finished programs and frustration. However, you don’t need to be a computer genius to code fun and creative programs.
where you’re encouraged to manually copy the programs, play with them, and inspect their inner workings by running them under a debugger.
Programming is a fun, creative skill to develop. Whether you’ve mastered the basics of Python syntax or simply want to dive into some real Python programs, the projects in this repo will spark new ideas for what’s possible with as little as a few pages of code.

The best way to work through these programs isn’t to merely read their code or copy and paste it to your computer. Take the time to manually type the code from this book into your editor to develop the muscle memory for writing code. This also slows you down so you can consider each line as you type, instead of merely skimming it over with your eyes. Look up any instructions you don’t recognize using an internet search engine, or experiment with them in the interactive shell.

  I will share 21 small projects to this repository Finally, take it upon yourself to re-create the program from scratch and then modify it with features of your own. These exercises give you a solid foundation for how programming concepts are applied to create actual, runnable programs. And most of all, don’t forget to have fun!



# bagels_project(project 1)
python short game which is very good for beginners to start a small project which helps the understanding and maturity in python

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
the game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place,
Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.


I insisted on all who are new to programming how to do  this small project some steps will be followed-
First step ---> You can copy the code to become familiar with how they work
Second step --> Experiment with your own changes and see what happen if you change something and see the output 
Third step --> re-attempt to recreate in your own as a practice which gives an idea of how to program and how to create
 #This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and all other characters are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image you’d like. The binary simplicity of the space-or-message-characters system makes it good for beginners. Try experimenting with different messages to see what the results look like!

# bitmap message(project 2)
This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user.

# Caesar cipher(project 3)

The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It encrypts letters by shifting them over by a certain number of places in the alphabet. We call the length of shift the key. For example, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm.
